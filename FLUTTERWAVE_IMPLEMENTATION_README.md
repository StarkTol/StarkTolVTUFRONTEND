   User goes to /dashboard/wallet/fund
   → Sees current balance
   → Enters amount (minimum ₦100)
   → Clicks "Proceed to Payment"
   ```

2. **Payment Initiation**
   ```
   Frontend calls POST /api/v1/payment/initiate
   → Backend creates Flutterwave payment link
   → Frontend redirects to Flutterwave checkout
   ```

3. **Payment Processing**
   ```
   User completes payment on Flutterwave
   → Flutterwave processes payment
   → User redirected to /dashboard/wallet/fund/success
   ```

4. **Payment Verification**
   ```
   Success page verifies payment with backend
   → Backend webhook receives confirmation
   → Wallet balance updated in real-time
   → Transaction record created
   → User sees success message
   ```

5. **Real-time Updates**
   ```
   Supabase broadcasts wallet update
   → Frontend receives real-time update
   → Balance updated across all components
   → Toast notification shown
   → Transaction appears in history
   ```

## 🔔 Notifications System

The implementation includes a comprehensive notification system:

- **Payment Initiated**: "Redirecting to payment page..."
- **Payment Successful**: "Payment successful! Wallet funded with ₦X"
- **Payment Failed**: "Payment failed. Please try again."

- **Balance Updates**: Real-time toast when balance changes

## 📊 Real-time Features

### Supabase Integration
- **Wallet Updates**: Listen for balance changes

wallets: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

// Transaction updates  
transactions: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
```

## 🧪 Testing

   - Use test card numbers for different scenarios

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Complete payment and watch balance update
